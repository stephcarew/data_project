#Summary of Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset

##Study Design
The study design in described in the file README.md

##Code Book
The below information pertains to the data set tidy_data.txt, which summarizes the data collected in the original study.

**Variables:**

1. Subject Number
+ Which subject (numbered 1-30) the summary data pertains to
+ unitless

2. Activity
+ which activity the subject performed (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
+ unitless
  	
3. Summary of measurement data variables. All of the below variables are the mean of the described measurements for a particular subject and activity. All measurements have been normalized and are therefore unitless. Additional information on how these measurements were taken can be found in features_info.txt
